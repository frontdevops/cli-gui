# CLI GUI
Set of scripts for create simple GUI from terminal

Tired of displaying raw text on Console? I tell you how to modernize your Bash/ZSH scripts by adding some GUI.

Sometimes you need a simple program for some kind of automation on MacOS and you don’t want to write a full-fledged application. Zsh and Bash are powerful enough tools, but if you need to provide such an application for “people” rather than programmers, in that case it is better to add at least some simple GUI.

MacOS has a powerful tool in the form of Apple Script, but you have to learn how to write it. I know a lot about Bash scripting. Therefore, it is easier for me to write the basic logic code in pure Bash. But to add GUI you can use either AppleScript or some additional libraries.

I will tell you not only about the third-party libraries, but also how to use the built-in tools and give you my own little GUI tools written in Bash and using the applescript calls.
